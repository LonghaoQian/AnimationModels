## What is this package?
- Provides a compact and easy way to generate animations from flight simulation data.
- Encapsulates and concentrates individual 3D rendering functions into a single function to provide a clean and concrete interface. 
- I also provide [background information and coding guide](examples/README.md) about how to generate animations in a Matlab environment.
- [The coding guide](examples/README.md) also teaches you about how to build your own customized visualization based on the code in this package.
