# The Overall Procedure
The overall procedure of the entire process is summerized in the following figure:

## How to modify the code to fit your need?


# Create 3D models 
## Model provide in this package

- please read [Model Building](background/model_building.md) for more details of building a 3d model in Matlab.

# Rotate and translate your model

- [Matlab Animation Frame System](background/animation_frame_system.md) explains in details about how frame systems work in Matlab.

- Rotation and translation are done by using 

## Model with manipulate components
