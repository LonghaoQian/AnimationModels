# Background of Rotations
## Syntax of Rotation Matrices

There are two reference frames: frame 1 and frame 2. The rotation matrix between frame 1 and frame 2 is defined as $R_{21}$.
This means that for the same vector $\vec{a}$, its coordinates in frame 1 and frame 2, i.e. $a_1$ and $a_2$, have the following relationship:

$$a_2=R_{21}a_1$$

## Euler angles and the corresponding rotation matrix

The rotation of reference frames can be achieved by using the euler angles around principle axis. We use $\phi$, $\theta$, $\psi$ to denote the roll, pitch, and yaw angle representing the rotation around the x, y, and z-axis. If frame 1 is the stationary frame, and frame 2 rotates w.r.t. frame 1 by an Euler angle, then the rotation matrix between frame 1 and 2 is as follows:

The functions in the [utils folder](../../src/utils/) generate rotation matrices around principle axis:

```
\src\utils\util_rotationX.m
\src\utils\util_rotationY.m
\src\utils\util_rotationZ.m
```

# Coordinate Frames
## The ENU (east-north-up frame) and the NED (north-east-down frame)
- There are two major frames used in this package: the ENU frame and the NED frame, as shown in the following figure:

- The rotation matrix between the END frame (frame E) and the NED frame (frame N) is
